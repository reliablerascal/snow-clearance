# Chicago's Sidewalk Snow Clearance: The North Side Complains, the South Side Gets Fined

This data analysis supports a two-part series for South Side Weekly:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://southsideweekly.com/sidewalk-plowing-pilot-planned-for-next-winter/">Part I: Sidewalk-Plowing Pilot Planned for Next Winter</a></strong> explores Chicago's proposed Plow the Sidewalks Ordinance, while highlighting the disparity between a high concentration of unshoveled sidewalk complaints on the North Side vs. the high concentration of fines levied on the South Side.
<li><strong>Part II: Fines Donâ€™t Shovel Sidewalks</strong> will explore different snow clearance enforcement strategies by three different city departments, and how enforcement might be influenced by aldermanic perogative and urban landscape.
</ul>
 
## Key Findings
My key findings for Part I are as follows:
* <strong>3-1-1 complaints</strong> about unshoveled sidewalks are concentrated on the North Side.
   * **Lincoln Square** ranks first with an average of fifty-seven complaints per 10,000 residents each year between 2019 and 2023.
   * South and West Side communities have the fewest, with **West Pullman** last at only two complaints per 10,000 residents.
* Preliminary analysis of Department of Administrative Hearings <strong>snow clearance fines</strong> data shows eight of the ten community areas with the most hearings for fines per capita are on the South Side.
   * **Englewood**, which ranks forty-ninth in 3-1-1 complaints, had the most administrative hearings per capita since 2019, and the highest amount of fines levied.
   * **Lincoln Square**, which ranks first in 3-1-1 complaints, was twenty-second in administrative hearing dockets per capita.

## Overview of Data Analysis

### Part I- 311 Complaints
Data preparation involved the following steps:
* Review 311 complaints data structures and explore data 
* Acquire census data and 311 complaints data, parse dates and snow seasons
* *Read snow clearance fines data, parse dates, clean addresses and prepare for geocoding
* In **QGIS**:
    <ol>
    <li>gather files- points (CSV of snow clearance fines and addresses) and shapes (Chicago community areas GeoJSON)
    <li>import fines/addresses as Delimited Text Layer
    <li>geocode addresses using MMQGIS
    <li>import Chicago Community Areas regions GeoJSON
    <li>perform point-in-polygon spatial join
    <li>export geocoded data as fines-geocoded-communities.csv
    </ol>

## What I Learned
I learned to geocode Administrative Hearings address data to get lat and long coordinates, and then spatially join this data to identify the community areas associated with each fine.

## Data Quirks and Other E-Varmints Standing in My Righteous Path
<ul>
<li>
Due to typos and mispellings of addresses in the Administrative Hearings data on snow clearance fines, some manual cleaning was required.
<li>I hoped to find a dataset of vacant properties that I could join to addresses identified in snow clearance fines, but according to a source at the Cook County Assessor's office such a dataset may not exist.
